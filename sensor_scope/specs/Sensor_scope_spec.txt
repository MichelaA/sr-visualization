A lot of this functionality has to do with being able to pick out signals from
a crowd of many signals.



Functions:

    Turn on or off graphs of all available signals.

    Change transmission rate of signals.

    Each signal can draw two types of graph:
    * Full-scale graph where top of window represents max possible value for integer type (e.g. 65535).
      Bottom of window represents 0. This graph can be vertically zoomed.
    * Bit-level graph where one pixel represents one LSB of signal. This graph cannot be zoomed.

    Each signal has the following adjustments:
    * Is signed / unsigned data.
    * Show full-scale graph (Tick box)
    * Show bit-level graph  (Tick box)
    * Show zero line        (Tick box)
    * Adjust vertical scale of full-scale graph.
    * Display mode:
      - pixels only. Each sample is represented by a single pixel. Zooming the time axis too much leads to gaps between pixels
      - Large pixels only. Same as above with large pixels.
      - Each sample represented by a horizontal line.
    * Highlight mode: (Tick box) If any signals have this box ticked, then all unticked signals go to 25% brightness, and go to the background.
    * vertical offset: +1/3 ; 0 ; -1/3

    Each signal also shows the following data in text form:
    * Absolute value of the integer in 0x%04x format.
    * Calibrated value in real units if available.
    * Some sense of the amount of noise (not urgent)


    Zoom X: Zoom the time axis using the mouse scroll wheel. Zoom centred on the mouse cursor position.
    Zoom Y: Zoom the Y axis by hovering the mouse over the name of the signal, and using the scroll wheel.

    Drag: Right-click and hold the graph to stop time. Drag mouse to scroll the graph in the X and Y directions.
          Release the mouse to let time flow again.

    When time is stopped, moving the mouse on the graph does the following:
    * Render faint vertical line at mouse X position.
    *


    Render flags: The flags data is harder to render, but I think we can render it like this:

    Current choke:              ******************************
    EEPROM writing:        **************
    CRC Failed
    Config out of range:

    I.E. render the names of the flags on the left of the screen. Render a rectangle for each flag.
    The rectangles scroll along with the other graphs, but the names stay fixed.
